1. Predict what Lisp will print in response to each of these expressions. Then try it and make sure your answer was correct, or if not, that you understand why!

   ```Scheme
   (define a 3) ; a = 3
   (define b (+ a 1)) ; b = 4
   (+ a b (* a b)) ; 19
   (= a b) ; #f
   (if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
       b
       a) ; 4
   (cond ((= a 4) 6)
       ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
       (else 25)) ; 16
   (+ 2 (if (> b a) b a)) ; 6
   (* (cond ((> a b) a)
       ((< a b) b)
       (else -1))
       (+ a 1)) ; 16
   ((if (< a b) + -) a b) ; 7
   ```

2. In the shell, type the command:

   `cp ~cs61a/lib/plural.scm.`

   (Note the period at the end of the line!) This will copy a file from the class library to your own directory.

   Then, using emacs to edit the file, modify the procedure so that it correctly handles cases like (`plural â€™boy`).

   answer:

   ```Scheme
   (define (plural wd)
       (if (and (equal? (last wd) 'y)
               (not (vowel? (last (bl wd)))))
           (word (bl wd) 'ies)
           (word wd 's)))
   ```

3. Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

   answer:

   ```Scheme
   (define (square x) ((* x x)))

   (define (sumTwoLargerNumbers x y z)
   (cond ((and (<= x y) (<= x z)) (+ (square y) (square z)) )
           ((and (<= y x) (<= y z)) (+ (square x) (square z)) )
           ((and (<= z x) (<= z y)) (+ (square x) (square y)) )
   ))
   (sumTwoLargerNumbers 1 2 3) -> 13
   ```

4. Write a procedure `dupls-removed` that, given a sentence as input, returns the result of removing duplicate words from the sentence. It should work this way:

   answer:

   ```Scheme
   (define (dupls-removed sentence)
   (if (empty? sentence)
       '()
       (se
           (if (member? (first sentence) (butfirst sentence))
               '()
               (first sentence))
           (dupls-removed (butfirst sentence)))))
   ```
