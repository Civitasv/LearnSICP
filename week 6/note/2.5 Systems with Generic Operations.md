# 2.5 Systems with Generic Operations

In the previous section, we saw how to design systems in which data objects can be represented in more than one way. The key idea is to link the code that specifies the data oprations to the several representations by means of generic interface procedures. Now we will see how to use this same idea not only to define operations that are generic over different representations but also to define operations that are generic over different kinds of arguments.

## 2.5.1 Generic Arithmetic Operations

## 2.5.2 Combining Data of Different Types

Formulating coherent policies on the division of responsibility among packages can be an overwhelming task in designing systems with many packages and many cross-type operations.

### Coercion

Often the different data types are not completely independent, and there may be ways by which objects of one type may be viewed as being of another type. This process is called _coercion_.

### Hierarchies of types

### Inadequacies of hierarchies
