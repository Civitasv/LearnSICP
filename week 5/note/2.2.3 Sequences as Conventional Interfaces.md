# Sequences as Conventional Interfaces

In this section, we introduce another powerful design principle for working with data structures-the use of _conventional interfaces_.

## Sequence Operations

The value of expressing programs as sequence operations is that this helps us make program designs that are modular, that is, designs that are constructed by combining relatively independent pieces.

Modular construction is a powerful strategy for controlling complexity in engineering design.
